# viridian-auto-restarter

simple restarter to restart it after a X amount of time

timer in seconds

**A compiled version is in releases if you dont have python and or your vps doesnt have it installed, so you dont have to go through installing it**

First put the main.py or main.exe depending on what one you downloaded, in the same folder as viridian, along with the settings.json file it comes with

once done, I recommend you to create a shortcut for main.py or main.exe and putting it in your windows start menu folder, what this does is every time your vps crashes the application can auto restart your bot, if you need help adding it to your start menu folder, go to the file manager, you will see a thing that looks kinda like this [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48303729/180705783-b697efc8-60ca-4b6d-ba57-77db3089fa1a.png) click to the right of everything, and copy paste this in `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` that will bring you to the start menu folder where you can drop the shortcut into.

after that boom you are done just run the file to host the trade bot manager!
